<!-- Queries here are related to the XML document in the folder '04_XML/agenda.xml'
    This will be an XPath.-->

This is a text file as it was unclear where to write 'just' the queries in.

Query 1:
        What is the starting time of the second course?
Solution :  /agendaListing[@title="agenda"]/row[2]/Debut

Query 2:  
        What is the starting time of the TP/TD on 09/09/2020?
Solution : /agendaListing[@title="agenda"]/row[9]/Debut[@Name="class-start"]/text()
Query 3: 
        What are the names of the courses occurring after 25/09/2020?
Solution : /agendaListing[@title="agenda]/row[<5]/titre/text()

Query 4:
        What is the duration of the TP/TD on 09/09/2020 ?
Solution : /agendaListing[@title="agenda"]/row[9]/Debut[@Name="class-start"]/text() - /agendaListing[@title="agenda"]/row[9]/Fin/text()
        (I'm not sure if this is correct, but I read that subtraction expressions along with addition, multiplication and division are available in XPath.)
